## What is The Machine?

The idea is to create a facial recognition system capable of detecting certain facial attributes, similar to what we would see in a surveillance system.
The attributes implemented are :

Gender (male/female)
Presence or absence of glasses
Origin (European, African, Asian, etc.)

The tools I used to realize this are :

openCV for image/video processing
DeepFace for gender and origin detection
DLIB & Edge Detection routine for glasses

Everything is grouped together in a tkinter interface so that you can select the functions you want in real time. It's also possible to load an image and process it directly.

done during the semester for an image processing course, at Haute-Ecole ARC, Neuch√¢tel.
